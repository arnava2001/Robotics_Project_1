# Robotics_Project_1




There is an executable that you can run to see the current progress. It allows the user to press buttons and move the robot, but these movements are completely incorrect. It just shows that the GUI will correctly read the position of the robot and draw it to the screen.

If you click the paint button, it will draw a little circle at the end of the brush.

Above is the link to get OpenGl working. You need the three files that are on git.

I think the only settings I have different in my Visual Studios is:

Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Precompiled Headers -> Precompiled Header

Changed "Precompiled Header" to "Not Using Precompiled Headers".

The other changes required for Visual Studios are mentioned in the link above.
